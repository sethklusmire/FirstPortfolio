# HomeworkOct4

In our week 2 homework I created a responsive Portfolio complete with home page, contact page and portfolio page. The pages should link to each other and respond to mobile first as seen fit.

The Main contributors were:
Bootstrap
Unsplash
Mike Myers
W3 Schools


How I went about this:
Created index, portfolio, and contact files.
Created a styles.css folder.
Filed in each html using bootstrap code.
